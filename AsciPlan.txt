TODO:
    - Deal additional damage if collides with certain mask (e. g. obstacles) while in stagger
    - Cut out limbs (arms) 
        limbs have their own separated health controller while connected and collision 
        when health falls down to 0 limbs are separated
        they become separated rigidbodies with their own health and could be destroyed separately

        Remember to ensure that connected arms will be destroyed if the whole body will be destroyed
        and to ensure separated limbs wont be affected by body destruction
